# PSAdapter

This is a FeedbackProvider and SuggestionPredictor for native utilities which
have an adapter written for them, or if the `jc` utility is installed suggestions
on how it may be incorporated into the users command line.

The following is a transcript where the `uname` command is used and has a
`uname-adapter` script which can convert the output to an object, as well as
how `jc` can be used to transform the text output into an object suitable
for use with PowerShell.

This module will work only with PowerShell 7.4 preview 3 or newer.
